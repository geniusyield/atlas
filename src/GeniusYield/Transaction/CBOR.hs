The transaction CBOR as obtained by Cardano API library may not be in format as desired by some hardware/browser wallets. This module attempts to simplify this obtained CBOR to the manner more acceptable.

Review this file whenever a hardfork occurs.

{- | Function to simplify transaction CBOR.

We as of now, only modify @transaction_body@ (terms are as defined in [CDDL](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/blob/master/eras/babbage/test-suite/cddl-files/babbage.cddl)) in it.

The modifications done is as follows:-

* All indefinite-length items are made definite.
* Wherever map occurs, it's keys are sorted as required by [CIP 21](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip21/).

-- | This `GYTxBody` doesn't represent @transaction_body@ as mentioned in [CDDL](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/blob/master/eras/babbage/test-suite/cddl-files/babbage.cddl) specification, it's API's internal type to represent transaction without signing key witnesses. However `GYTx` does represent `transaction` as defined in specification. We therefore obtain `GYTx` and work with it. Here we need an invariant, which is if we receive our simplified `GYTx` transaction, then obtaining `GYTxBody` via `getTxBody` and obtaining `GYTx` back via `unsignedTx` should have the same serialisation for the modifications to CBOR encoding we do here.
